Meeting Title: Q1 Product Roadmap Discussion
Date: March 15, 2025
Participants: John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen, Emma Williams, David Kim, Lisa Rodriguez

[09:00 AM] John Smith: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining our Q1 product roadmap discussion. Today we'll review the current status, prioritize features for the next quarter, and assign responsibilities.

[09:02 AM] Sarah Johnson: Good morning! I've prepared a summary of user feedback from the last release that I think should inform our priorities.

[09:03 AM] Mike Chen: I also have the engineering capacity numbers to share as we plan.

[09:05 AM] John Smith: Great. Let's start with a quick status update of our current release. David, can you give us a summary?

[09:06 AM] David Kim: Sure. We successfully launched version 2.4 last month with the redesigned dashboard and improved export functionality. We've seen a 15% increase in dashboard usage and positive feedback on the export feature. However, we still have some performance issues on mobile devices that we need to address.

[09:08 AM] Emma Williams: I can confirm that our support tickets related to mobile performance have increased by 23% since the last release.

[09:10 AM] John Smith: Thanks for highlighting that. Let's make mobile optimization a priority for Q1. Sarah, can you share the user feedback you collected?

[09:12 AM] Sarah Johnson: Absolutely. The top three requests from users are: 1) Better mobile performance, 2) Integration with third-party calendar apps, and 3) Customizable notification settings.

[09:15 AM] John Smith: That aligns well with our internal priorities. Let's discuss each of these in more detail.

[09:16 AM] Mike Chen: For the mobile performance issues, we've identified the main bottlenecks. It will take approximately 3 weeks of engineering time to resolve.

[09:18 AM] Lisa Rodriguez: I can allocate my team to this task. We should be able to deliver an improvement by the end of April.

[09:20 AM] John Smith: Excellent. Let's move on to the calendar integration feature.

[09:22 AM] David Kim: I've researched the top calendar APIs we should support. Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar would cover about 95% of our user base.

[09:25 AM] Sarah Johnson: The product design for this feature is almost complete. I'll share the mockups by the end of this week.

[09:27 AM] Mike Chen: This is a bigger feature and will require about 6 weeks of development time.

[09:30 AM] John Smith: Let's schedule this for the second half of Q1. Lisa, can your team take this on after completing the mobile optimization?

[09:32 AM] Lisa Rodriguez: Yes, we should be able to start this in early May.

[09:35 AM] John Smith: Perfect. Now for the customizable notifications.

[09:37 AM] Emma Williams: Our support team has compiled the most requested notification options. I'll share the document after this meeting.

[09:40 AM] Mike Chen: This should be a relatively straightforward feature to implement. I estimate about 2 weeks of development time.

[09:42 AM] David Kim: I can assign this to my team. We can work on it in parallel with the mobile optimization.

[09:45 AM] John Smith: Sounds good. Before we wrap up, are there any critical bugs or issues we need to address in Q1?

[09:47 AM] Emma Williams: There's an intermittent data sync issue affecting about 2% of users. It's not critical, but it's causing confusion and generating support tickets.

[09:50 AM] Mike Chen: We've identified the root cause. It's related to our cache management. Should take about 1 week to fix.

[09:52 AM] John Smith: Let's prioritize that for early Q1. David, can your team handle this alongside the notification feature?

[09:53 AM] David Kim: Yes, we can manage both tasks.

[09:55 AM] John Smith: Great. To summarize, our Q1 priorities are: 
1. Fix the data sync bug (David's team, by end of March)
2. Mobile performance optimization (Lisa's team, by end of April)
3. Customizable notifications (David's team, by mid-April)
4. Calendar integration (Lisa's team, starting May)

[09:58 AM] Sarah Johnson: That sounds like a solid plan. I'll coordinate with the marketing team to announce these upcoming features.

[10:00 AM] John Smith: Thank you all for your input. I'll send out the detailed roadmap document by tomorrow. Our next check-in will be in two weeks to track progress.

[10:02 AM] Meeting ended
